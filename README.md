# PSII
This extractor computes the characteristic fluorescence features for dark and light-adapted plants. Following features are available:
Fv_dark/Fm_dark The maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII 
Fv_dark/Fm_dark The maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII 
Quantum yield of photosynthesis 
Non-photochemical quenching, absorbed light energy that is dissipated (mostly by thermal radiation) 
Proportion of closed PSII reaction centers 
Proportion of open PSII reaction centers 
Ratio of chlorophyll decrease to steady state Chlorophyll
